<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/coutry-quiz-screenshot.png)

Just right above are a few screenshots of my project.

  - The whole demo exist inside of the **App.js** file which is the main component that contains all of my functions and logics. And there are five(05) other subcomponents that render each of my **jsx**.


-   My experience:

    In this project, I faced quite a lot of struggles to get most of the features.
   Generating questions randomly and get  answers randomly from just one API key was not an easy thing to do. It took me quite a long time.

     But I loved it when I could exchange between the types of questions and answeres are automatically rendered randomly.


-   What I have learned/improved:

    I learned new things by creating questios and answers options from an API key. I t was amzing! 
  
    Also, I found out that it is useful to always store all of the things we need and still want to use and update in states so that your logics will be easier to handle.

    Having good variable and function names is a key to understand much more about our code. Names should always relate to what it does so that those will create a lot of confusion while you are coding and help the others to understand our code easily too.

    I also found out that having a plan of general logics before coding is needed in order not to waist our time. That will allowa us focus on imprtant things rather than dealing with the small parts but creates cofusion before the others.

-   Your wisdom? :)
